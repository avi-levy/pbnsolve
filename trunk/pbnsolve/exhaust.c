/* EXHAUSTIVE STRATEGY - This is a desparate last gasp to try before giving up
 * on logical solving.  It tries every cell in every color possible to it
 * and checks if it's row nd column has become insolvable.  This is a
 * cover-up for the inadequacies of the left-right-overlap linesolving
 * algorithm and would be completely useless if that didn't miss some things.
 * As it is, it serves to ensure that we don't start guessing unless
 * we really can't get further with logical solving, so it makes pbnsolve
 * more reliable at identifying line-solvable puzzles.  Whether it makes
 * pbnsolve faster is doubtful.

 * Just tried setting every cell whose color had not been determined to each
 * of it's possible colors, and then for each color doing a left_solve() on
 * the row and column of the cell to see if there is a contradiction.  This
 * worked, but made poor use of the information coming back from the solver.
 * It gives you a whole line solution, which tells you possible colors for
 * more than just the one cell you called it on.  So now we use a scratch
 * pad array to keep track of all the possibilities that we accidentally
 * proved while checking previous cells, so we don't need to check those
 * possibilities again on future cells.
 *
 * If check is false, we assume that everything on the puzzle grid is OK and
 * we do not look for contradictions.  If check is true, we look for
 * errors and return a negative number if one is found.
 *
 * We return zero if we learned nothing, and a positive number if we set at
 * least one cell.
