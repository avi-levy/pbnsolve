/* LINE_SCORE_SIMPSON - A version of Steve Simpson's line scoring system.
 * Near as I can tell, Simpson's heuristic function is:
 *
 *    score =   L                            if B = L (line is full)
 *              B*(N+1) + N * (N - L - 1)    otherwise
 *
 * where
 *     L = line length
 *     N = number of clues
 *     B = sum of clue numbers
 *
 * Makes no particular sense to me, but there it is.
 *
 * We make a few changes.  First, we negate it, since we always minimize
 * instead of maximizing like Steve does.
 *
 * Second, since we already have computed slack but not B.  We rewrite the
 * formula to use that instead, Slack is L - B - N + 1 in the case of a two
 * color puzzle.  If we negate Simpson's formula and plug in slack (S) instead
 * of B, and do some algebra, we get:
 *
 *     score= -L			if S = 0
 *  	      (S+1)(N+1) - L - 2	otherwise
 *
 * I don't think the -L parts here make any difference. Since when we use this
 * with cell_score_add() we always add a row score and a column score, so
 * this, like the 2, is just a constant.  Seems like the main part of this is
 * the (S+1)(N+1) bit, which is not so very different from my algorithms.
