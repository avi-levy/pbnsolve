PBNSOLVE VERSION 1.0

This software is open source.  Any use may be made of it so long as the
author's name and copyright are retained.

To compile:

   edit config.h

      Might want to change some of the settings here.

   edit Makefile

      Mainly to get include paths for libxml2 right.

   "make pbnsolve"

Run syntax is:

   pbnsolve -[cdhlpt] -[vvv] [-s <n>] <datafile>

Command line options:

   -c
        Input puzzle in expected to include a solution grid.  We check to
	see if that is the unique solution.

   -d  
        Print a descripition of the puzzle before starting to solve it.

   -h  
        Run in http mode.  Output is XML-formatted in a way suitable for
	use in an AJAX-application.

   -l  
        Do logical solving only, no backtracking, probing or guessing.

   -p  
        Do not do probing.  Instead use heuristics to guess cells.

   -s<n>
        Start solving from one of the "saved" solutions in the input file.
	<n> is the number of the input to use, if there is more than one.

   -t  
        After run is completed, print statistics on run time.

   -u
   	Check uniqueness.  Determine if the puzzle has a unique solution.

   -v  
        Run verbose.

   -vv 
        Run more verbose.

   -vvv
        Run even more verbose.

If the program is renamed "pbnsolve.cgi" then it will work as an AJAX
application.  It ignore command line arguments, take it's input from
a CGI variable named "image" and run as if -h and -c were set.
