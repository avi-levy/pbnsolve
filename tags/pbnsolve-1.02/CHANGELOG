version 1.01 - May 23, 2009
  - add CHANGELOG
  - print version number on startup if verbose
  - add merging on probes.  This looks for cells that were set to the same
    value on all probes of different color settings for some other cell.
    This, alas, seems to just slow us down on nearly all puzzles.
  - after logical solving gets stuck for the first time, but before we start
    guessing, try setting every cell to every possible cover, and check if any
    of these settings contradict any clue.  There is a chance that this will
    find some markable squares missed by the LRO linesolver.
  - Finer control of debugging messages.

version 1.0 - Sep 10, 2007
