version 1.09 - Apr 28, 2010
  - Massively rewrote all the code having to do with heuristic functions,
    most of which hasn't been used in a while because we have prefered
    probing.  Now have much more flexibility to select different heuristics
    from the command line.
  - Also implemented a version of Steve Simpson's heuristic function that can
    be selected with the -aG4 flag.  This is the new default heuristic.
  - If both probing and guessing are turned on (-aLGP), then we use probing
    until the rate of finding contradictions falls below 88%, and then try
    using heuristic search for a while.  This makes no difference on most
    puzzles, slows us down a bit on a few, and helps a lot on a few others.
    It is the new default.
  - Added ablility to probe on cells that were given a top rating by the
    heuristic functions.  This gave good performance increases on some puzzles,
    but caused serious problems on a few others.  Not on by default. Can be
    selected with -aP3 or -aP4 options.
  - Added -i flag.  If set, interupts cause the program to print statistics
    and ask if you want to continue.

version 1.08 - Apr 22, 2010
  - Added probing on all neighbors of cells changed since the last probe.  This
    is another idea from the Ben Gurion University project.  Gives us
    substantial performance gains on many puzzles, and mild performance loses
    on a few.  The old probing algorithm can be selected by -aP1.  This is -aP2.
  - Can now select between heuristic search algorithms from the command line,
    using the -aG1, -aG2, or -aG3 flags.
  - Modified caching algorithm so solutions for lines with clues that are
    the reverse of each other are cached together.  This ended up having
    very little effect on performance.

version 1.07 - Apr 18, 2010
  - Add caching of line solutions. This idea comes from the Ben Gurion
    University Solver project.  Works very well.  Defaults on.

version 1.06 - Jan 7, 2010
  - Better output in case of puzzle with no solutions.
  - Fix some bugs that manifested when starting from a partially complete
    solution loaded from an XML file.

version 1.05 - June 19, 2009
  - Improved probing performance by having it remember all cells that were
    set on previous probes and not probe on those, since they can't possibly
    give a better result.
  - Performance improvements and bug fixes to merging algorithm, but it still
    isn't a net gain.  Makes some puzzles a little faster, and some a little
    slower.  Tends toward a little slower on the really hard puzzles.  So we
    leave it turned off by default.
  - Added ability to read Olsak .g files, except triddlers and triangle
    puzzles.

version 1.04 - June 17, 2009
  - Added caching of old left/right solutions for each line, and reuse of them
    when possible to speed up line solving.  This adds a heck of a lot of
    complexity, and only a little speed-up.  Might not have been that great
    an idea.
  - Restructured main search algorithm to separate code for the different
    search strategies instead of tangling them all together.  Mostly for
    code readability and debuggability.
  - Added contradiction checking algorithm.  Goal of this is to identify
    puzzles that can be solved with limited lookahead, and are thus perhaps
    more human solvable.  I'm not convinced yet that it really does that.  It
    seems to make some puzzles solve faster, but others slower.  For now it's
    still experimental and not on by default.
  - Differentiation of my old "int" variables into "line_t", "color_t" and
    "dir_t" typedefs.
  - Reduce amount of allocating and releasing of dynamic memory we do in
    line_lro.c.  This gives some small speed increases.
  - Keep undo history in an array instead of a linked list.  Another trick
    to cut back on dynamic memory allocation.
  - Sight efficience improvements to bit string operators, including adding
    LIMITCOLORS mode.  More speed increases.
  - Watch individual lines with the -w command line option.  A useful debugging
    tool.
  - Revisions to job priority assignment.  If a color change to a cell creates
    edge, then the row that would cross the edge gets a boost to it's
    priority.

version 1.03 - May 31, 2009
  - Improved efficiency of try_everything() routine by adding a scratchpad.
    Also broke it out to a separate file.
  - Fixed a bug that caused an incomplete solution to be printed although a
    complete solution had been found with the -u flag.
  - Command line arguments rearranged, with new -a option to control algorithm
    choice.
  - Some rearrangement of code now to make it possible (though not desirable)
    to run using the exhaustive check instead of the line solver.  This is
    really mostly to test that the exhaustive check is working correctly.
  - Ability to read input format of Bosch's LP solver.

version 1.02 - May 26, 2009
  - Ability to read several black & white puzzle puzzle file formats.
  - Ability to read pbm image files as puzzles.
  - Addition of -b "terse mode" flag.
  - Addition of -f option to explicitly set file formats.
  - Ability to set cpu limits from command line with -x<secs> flag.
  - Command line version now reads puzzle from standard input if no file
    name is given.
  - For files containing multiple puzzles, puzzle index to solve is now
    given on -n option.
  - In cgi-mode, a CGI argument name "format" can be passed which contains
    a string identifying the file format.
  - Attached Apache 2.0 license to the distribution.
  - Improvement of documentation.

version 1.01 - May 23, 2009
  - add CHANGELOG
  - print version number on startup if verbose
  - add merging on probes.  This looks for cells that were set to the same
    value on all probes of different color settings for some other cell.
    This, alas, seems to just slow us down on nearly all puzzles.
  - after logical solving gets stuck for the first time, but before we start
    guessing, try setting every cell to every possible cover, and check if any
    of these settings contradict any clue.  There is a chance that this will
    find some markable squares missed by the LRO linesolver.
  - Finer control of debugging messages.

version 1.0 - Sep 10, 2007
  - original release
