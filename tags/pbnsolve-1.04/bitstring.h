/* Some bitstring manipulation macros.  These were written long ago by
 * Paul A. Vixie and were posted to mod.sources.  I'm assuming they are
 * open source.
 *
 * We have added the fbit_* functions which take advantage of the fact that
 * all bitstrings in pbnsolve are the same size and expect to find those
 * sizes in fbit_n (number of bits) and fbit_size (number of ints to store
 * those bits).  I tried caching _bit_intn(N) and _bit_mask(N) in arrays,
 * but that actually made things slower.
 *
 * If the LIMITCOLORS is defined at compile time, then the macros
 * are further optimized under the assumption that all bit strings fit in
 * one long int.
