PBNSOLVE VERSION 1.10
Jan Wolter

This software is open source, copyrighted by Jan Wolter, but released under
an Apache 2.0 License.

This software usually requires libxml2 which seems to be available on most
modern Unix systems.  It is also available from http://xmlsoft.org/.

It is possible to build pbnsolve without libxml2 by setting a flag in the
config.h file, but all the supported non-xml input file formats are rather
pathetic so this will pretty seriously cripple pbnsolve.  People only
interested in black and white puzzle might be able to get by with that.

Sample puzzles to test on can be obtained at http://webpbn.com/export.cgi
